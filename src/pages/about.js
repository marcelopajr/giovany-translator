      <p>
        Hello, I am a native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese who was born and
        raised in Cear√°, a state in the northeast of the country. Passionate
        about reading, I grew up surrounded by books on philosophy, science,
        history and with a lot of influence from cultures of different
        countries, a factor that contributed significantly to my education and
        to the choice of the translation profession.
      </p>

        Enthusiast of language studies. Currently, with a degree in
        Linguistics/English Language in progress, an opportunity that made me
        develop the necessary skills to provide a high quality translation that
        ensure style and context in the target language while applying proper
        parameters such as grammar, syntax, semantics and appropriate
        terminology. I have worked with translation from English to Portuguese
        for 3 years, helping agencies and clients to reach an international
        audience and share their content in the digital world.
