      <p>
        Hello, I am a native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese who was born and
        raised in Cear√°, a state in the northeast of the country. Passionate
        about reading, I grew up surrounded by books on philosophy, science,
        history, and with a lot of influence from cultures of different
        countries, a factor that contributed significantly to my education and
        to the choice of the translation profession.
      </p>

        Enthusiast of language studies. Currently with a degree in English
        Language in progress, an opportunity that made me develop the necessary
        skills to provide a high quality translation in the subtitling and
        technical translation market. I have worked with translation from
        English to Portuguese for 3 years, helping organizations like Ted Talk,
        Sikana and Rev to reach an international audience and share content in
        the digital world.
